Python Implementation of DriveWire 4 and EmCee Protocols

PyDriveWire is a nearly complete DriveWire4 Server written in Python. The
goal is to eventually implement all of the features available. The server
also implements additional features that are not available in DriveWire4.

PyDriveWire v0.4 also has experimental support for the EmCee Protocol for
use with MCX Basic on the TRS-80 MC-10.

DriveWire 4 and EmCee Procotols can be used simultaneously on the server
without reconfiguration.  Features

    (new for v0.4) Experimental EmCee Protocol Support
    (new for v0.4) Added Windows installation instructions
    (new for v0.4) Added pyDriveWire.bat file
    (updated v0.4) dw server dir and dw server list enhanced to run on ALL OSes (Mac/Windows/Linux, etc)
    (new for v0.3) Experimental printing support
    (new for v0.3) New command line parameters, see the "Run It" section for details
    Connections to serial ports at all supported baud rates: 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600
