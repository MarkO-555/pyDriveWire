# pyDriveWire v0.5c-dev
Python Implementation of DriveWire 4 and EmCee Protocols

PyDriveWire is a nearly complete DriveWire4 Server written in Python.  The goal is to eventually implement all of the features available.  The server also implements additional features that are not available in DriveWire4.

PyDriveWire v0.5 also has support for the EmCee Protocol for use with MCX Basic on the TRS-80 MC-10.  

DriveWire 4 and EmCee Procotols can be used simultaneously on the server without reconfiguration.

Notable Missing Features
------------------------
* MIDI
* OS9 `/Z` console windows
* MShell Support


Requirements
------------
* pypy -- For maximum performance it is recommended to run the server with
pypy.  pypy is a Python interpreter that does JIT compilation and results in
greatly increased speed
* pyserial -- Install using pip

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------
* Any OS where you can run Python, including but not limited to:
* Linux
* macOS
* Windows


Installation (Linux/macOS/UNIX)
------------
* Download Latest: [https://github.com/n6il/pyDriveWire/releases](https://github.com/n6il/pyDriveWire/releases)
* Mac: `brew install pypy; pypy -m pip install pyserial`
* Ubuntu: `apt-get install pypy; pypy -m pip install pyserial`

_Experimental Printing Support_

* `pypy -m pip install reportlab`


Installation (Windows)
------------
See the [Windows Installation of PyPy(Python) and pyDriveWire](docs/The%20pyDriveWire%20Manual.md#ch2) manual for details.
