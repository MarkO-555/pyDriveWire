pyDriveWire v0.5c

Python Implementation of DriveWire 4 and EmCee Protocols

PyDriveWire is a nearly complete DriveWire4 Server written in Python. The goal is to eventually implement all of
the features available. The server also implements additional features that are not available in DriveWire4.

PyDriveWire also has support for the EmCee Protocol for use with MCX Basic on the TRS-80 MC-10.

DriveWire 4 and EmCee Procotols can be used simultaneously on the server without reconfiguration.
