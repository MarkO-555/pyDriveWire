# The pyDriveWire Manual v0.5

Python Implementation of DriveWire 4 and EmCee Protocols

PyDriveWire is a nearly complete DriveWire4 Server written in Python.  The goal is to eventually implement all of the features available.  The server also implements additional features that are not available in DriveWire4.

PyDriveWire also has experimental support for the EmCee Protocol for use with MCX Basic on the TRS-80 MC-10.  

DriveWire 4 and EmCee Procotols can be used simultaneously on the server without reconfiguration.

# 2. <a name="ch2"></a>Getting Started
## 2.1 Requirements<a name="ch2.1"></a>

* pypy -- For maximum performance it is recommended to run the server with
pypy.  pypy is a Python interpreter that does JIT compilation and results in
greatly increased speed
* pyserial -- Install using pip

## 2.2 Supported Operating Systems
* Any OS where you can run Python, including but not limited to:
* Linux
* macOS
* Windows


## 2.3 Installation (Linux/macOS/UNIX)
* Download Latest: [https://github.com/n6il/pyDriveWire/releases](https://github.com/n6il/pyDriveWire/releases)
* Mac: `brew install pypy; pypy -m pip install pyserial`
* Ubuntu: `apt-get install pypy; pypy -m pip install pyserial`

_Experimental Printing Support_

* `pypy -m pip install reportlab`


## 2.4 Installation (Windows)

There are multiple ways to get Python and pyDriveWire installed on Windows.
As long as the basic requirements are met you can use any method to install
PyPy or Python.  The requirements and two fully-tested example installation
workflows are below.

### Requirements

* pyDriveWire is a Python 2.7 script.  It may or may not run on Python3
  (will likely migrate at a later time). 
* PyPy is preferred over CPython.  Pypy has Just-In-Time compilation and
  pyDriveWire will run a lot faster (and likely will also use lower CPU)
than CPython, but pyDriveWire is completely compatible with either one.
* Use the latest version of  _Python 2.7 Compatible PyPy for Windows_ or
  Python 2.7.X
* PyPy or Python should be installed in the system PATH
* PIP is required for installing required python modules
* PySerial module (use pip to install)
* Experimental Printing Support requires the ReportLab module (use pip to
  install)

### Bleeding Edge/Experimental/Pre-Release Features

The instructions below direct you to install the latest _stable release_
from the GitHub releases page.  If you would like to try out or help to
test the latest pyDriveWire code you can obtain pyDriveWire from it's

## Config File (global)

The pyDriveWire config file can be used to set all of the command line options.  This section tells you where to put the config file and how to specify it on the command line.  The details of the config file itself are in the [Using a Config File](#ch6) section of this manual.

The config file can either be in a default location or can be specified from the command line.

Please see the pyDriveWire Config File and Using Multiple Instances guides for more detail about the config file.

Note: Command line options have prescidence over config file.  This means that if both are specified the command line version will be used.

Note: Options are noted as either instance specific (instance) or global (global).  Global options can only be specified in Instance 0.

### Default Config file location

The default location for the config file is in your home directory: `~/.pydrivewirerc`

* Linux: `/home/<userid>/.pydrivewirerc`
* Mac: `/Users/<userid>/.pydrivewirerc`
* Windows: `C:\Users\<userid>\.pydrivewirerc`

Note: This option cannot be specified in a config file

### Specify a config file location: 

    -C <config_file>
    
or

    --config <config_file> 

## Serial Port (instance)



pyDriveWire will start a server instance which listens for the DriveWire or EmCee client on `<serial_port>` at `<baud>` 

* Linux/Mac:  This should be a device such as `/dev/ttyUSB0`
* Windows: `COM1`

### Command Line:

    --port <serial_port> --speed <baud>
or

    -p <serial_port> -s <baud>`

### Config File:

    option port <serial_port>
    option speed <baud>

Serial Port mode also supports RTS/CTS flow control.

Note: DO NOT use this with a CoCo or MC-10 Bit Banger port.  This is intended for use with a UART that properly implements flow control.  The RS-232 Pak or any device with a 6551 UART does not implement flow control properly.

### Command Line:

    -R
or

    --rtscts

### Config File:

    option rtscts [True|False]
    
Note: Omitting this option line defaults to `False`

## TCP Server (Accept Incoming Connections) (instance)

pyDriveWire will start a server instance which listens for the DriveWire or EmCee client on `<tcp_port>`.  Note that only one client can connect to each port.

### Command Line:

    --accept --port <tcp_port>
    
or
    
    -a -c <tcp_port>
   

### Config File:

    option accept True
    option port <tcp_port>
    
## Outgoing TCP Connections (instance)

pyDriveWire will start a server instance which makes an outgoing TCP connection to `<hostname>:<tcp_port>`.  Once that connection has been established pyDriveWire will listen for DriveWire or EmCee commands on that connection.  This is useful for many Telnet-To-Serial bridge devices.

### Command Line

    --connect --host <hostname> --port <tcp_port>
or

    -c -H <hostname> -p <tcp_port>

### Config File:

    option accept True
    option port <tcp_port>
    
## Web/HTTP UI (global)

pyDriveWire has a Web/HTTP User Interface.  See the [Web User Interface](#ch4) manual for more details.

### Command Line:

    -U <ui_port>

or

    --ui-port <ui_port>

### Config File:

    option uiPort <ui_port>
    
## Debugging (global)
The Debugging option on the command line or config file is _global_ and is applied to All Instances.

> Note: The config file option _must_ be put in Instance 0.

* Default: No Debugging (Level 0)
     * Command Line: Default without any option
     * Config File: Default without any option
     * Config File (optional): `option debug 0`
* Command Debugging (Level 1) 
     * Command Line: `-d` 
     * Config File: `option debug 1`
* Connection Debugging (Level 2)
     * Command Line: `-dd` 
     * Config File: `option debug 2`
 
## Start pyDriveWire in Daemon Mode (global)

> Note: If you are using a config file it is recommended to put the pid file and log file options in the config file and to run the server with `--daemon -C <config_file>`

> Note: If your config file is in the default location you do not need to specify it on the command line

### Command Line:

    --daemon [-C <config_file>] [--pid-file <pid_file> --log-file <log_file>]

### Config file:

    option daemon True/False
    option daemonPidFile <pid_file>
    option daemonLogFile <log_file>
    
    
## pyDriveWire in Daemon Mode Status

> Note: Either the config file or pid file option is required.

> Note: This option cannot be specified in a config file

> Note: If your config file is in the default location you do not need to specify it on the command line


### Command Line:

    --status [-C <config_file>]

or

    --status [--pid-file <pid_file>]

## Stop pyDriveWire in Daemon Mode

> Note: Either the config file or pid file option is required.

> Note: This option cannot be specified in a config file

> Note: If your config file is in the default location you do not need to specify it on the command line

### Command Line:

    --stop [-C <config_file>]

or

    --stop [--pid-file <pid_file>]

# 6. <a name="ch6"></a>Using a Config File

pyDriveWire accepts options from either the command line or a config file.
There are two ways to provide a config file to pyDriveWire:

* The `-C <cfgFile>` or `--config <cfgFile>` command line options
* A default config file in `~/.pydrivewirerc`

If the config file exists it is read in.  Options are applied to the config and commands are run through the command parser.

#### Note ####
    If both command line options and a config file are
    provided the command line options override the 
    config file options

## Config File Format ##
The config file has two different types of options

1. Options
2. Commands

_Options_ -- Option entries can be used to set any of the command line options to pyDriveWire.  Options always start with the word `option` and have the following format:

    option <optionName> <optionValue>

_Commands_ are any lines in the config file that are not options.  These are standard pyDriveWire commands and they are run through the command parser immediately on start-up so some of the commands may not make sense.

_Comments_ are any lines where the first non-whitespce character is a `#`

### Example Config File ###
    # options
    option accept True
    option port 65504
    option uiPort 6800
    
    # commands
    dw disk insert 0 /demo/DWTERM.dsk
    

For a full description of all the config file options please see the [Command Line and Config File Options](#ch3) guide.

### TCP/IP Accept Options ###
    option accept True
    option port 65504
    
### TCP/IP Connect Options ###
    option connect True
    option host 127.0.0.1
    option port 23
    
### Serial Options ###
    option port /dev/tty.usbserial
    option speed 115200
    
### Web Interface
    option uiPort 6800
    
### Daemon Mode
    option daemon True
    option daemonPidFile /tmp/pyDriveWire.pid
    option daemonLogFile /tmp/pyDriveWire.log
    
### Debug Options
    option debug <0|1|2>

# 7. <a name="ch7"></a>Multiple Instances
pyDriveWire allows you to configure and use multiple instances which all run in parallel.  Each instance talks to one DriveWire client and each can mount different disk images.  The instances are configured in a config file to specify the connection point and any options you wish to set for for each instance.

Note:  At the current time instances can only be specified in the config file and can only be started or stopped along with the main invocation of pyDriveWire.

## Configuring Multiple Instances

Instances are configured in a pyDriveWire Config file.

The options and commands for first instance `instance 0`  starts at the top of the config file and includes any lines which are not comments or blank lines.  The main instance commands and options stop at the first instance tag.

Additional instances can be added by adding an instance tag:

    [serial]
    
The name of the instance is for you to know what it's for, the server doesn't use it.

Instances are numbered sequentially.  The first instance is always instance 0.  The instance following that one is instance 1, etc.

Options and commands for the instance start after the instance tag and continue until the next instance tag.

Multiple instances can be specified.

## Example Config

    # Main Instance 
    option accept True
    option port 65504
    option uiPort 6800
    dw disk insert 0 /demo/plato.dsk
    
    [serial]
    option port /dev/ttyS0
    option speed 115200
    dw disk insert 0 /demo/DWTERM.dsk
    
    [connect]
    option connect True
    option host mfurman-a01.local
    option port 54321

Instance 0 listens on port 65504 for incoming connections and is mounting a disk image.

Instance 1 uses a serial port at 115200 baud and also mounts a disk image

Instance 2 makes an outgoing TCP/IP connection to the specified host and port.

## Instance Commands

pyDriveWire has a few commands to control instances.  These commands should only be used from the command line interface, the web interface, or pyDwCli.

Note: Using instance commands from a DriveWire Client is not recommended.

* `dw instance show`
* `dw instance select <inst>`

## `dw instance show`

Shows a list of the currently configured instances.  The current instance is marked with an asterisk `*`:

    pyDriveWire(0)>  dw instance show
    
    
    Inst.  Type
    -----  --------------------------------------
    0*     dwsocket.DWSocketServer localhost:65504
    1      dwserial.DWSerial /dev/ttyS0 115200
    2      dwsocket.DWSocket mfurman-a01.local:54321

## `dw instance select <inst>`

Switches to a different instance.

    pyDriveWire(0)>  dw instance select 1
    Selected Instance 1: dwserial.DWSerial /dev/ttyS0 115200
    pyDriveWire(1)>
    
The server will respond with a line telling you which instance you just switched to.
The command prompt will also change to show the current instance.  You can see in the example above that the original prompt was instance 0 and it switched to instance 1.

# 8. <a name="ch8"></a>Daemon Mode
When pyDriveWire is run on any Linux/Unix/macOs operating system it can be run in a daemon mode where the server in the background in a "daemon" mode.  When run in this mode there is no console repl and you must use either the Web UI or pyDwCli to control it.

Note: This mode is _not_ supported on Windows

# Configuring Daemon mode

Daemon mode can be enabled from either the config file or from the command line.  You do not need to specify both but you can.  Note that if you do specify both the config file parameters will override the command line ones.

## Daemon mode from a config file

Either put this in your `~/.pydrivewirerc` file, or invoke the server with `pyDriveWire -C <config_file>`

    option uiPort 6800
    option daemon True
    option daemonPidFile /tmp/pyDriveWire.pid
    option daemonLogFile /tmp/pyDriveWire.log
    [... additional options required ...]

## Command Line Options

    $ ./pyDriveWire -h
    usage: pyDriveWire.py [-U UIPORT] [-C CONFIG]
                          [--daemon] [--status] [--stop]
                          [--pid-file DAEMONPIDFILE] [--log-file DAEMONLOGFILE]
                          [FILE [FILE ...]]

    pyDriveWire Server v0.4

    positional arguments:
      FILE                  list of files

    optional arguments:
      -U UIPORT, --ui-port UIPORT
                            pyDriveWire UI Port
      -C CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                            Config File
      --daemon              Daemon Mode, No Repl
      --status              Daemon Status
      --stop                Daemon Status
      --pid-file DAEMONPIDFILE
                            Daemon Pid File
      --log-file DAEMONLOGFILE
                            Daemon Log File

## Starting daemon mode from the command line

The server can be invoked as follows from the command line:

    ./pyDriveWire \
            --ui-port 6800 \
            --daemon \
            --pid-file /tmp/pyDriveWire.pid \
            --log-file /tmp/pyDriveWire.log \
            [... additional required options ...]
            
This will start the server in `daemon` mode with a web UI listening on port `6800`.
    
## Checking server status

Example: Daemon mode is not running

    $ ./pyDriveWire --status
    pyDriveWire Server status:notRunning

Example: Deamon mode is running

    $ ./pyDriveWire --status
    pyDriveWire Server pid:1114 status:Running
  
  
## Stopping the server

    $ ./pyDriveWire --status
    pyDriveWire Server pid:1114 status:Running
    
    $ ./pyDriveWire --stop
    pyDriveWire Server pid:1114 msg:Stopped

    $ ./pyDriveWire --status
    pyDriveWire Server status:notRunning

# 9. <a name="ch9"></a>EmCee Server

## Experimental EmCee Protocol Support
pyDriveWire version v0.4 adds experimental support for the EmCee protocol used on the TRS-80 MC-10 running MCX Basic (MCX Basic is available on the MCX-128 expansion card).  The EmCee protocol support is always turned on allowing any application connected to a pyDriveWire server to use EmCee and DriveWire protocols simeltaneously.  With this setup one could use a DriveWire application on a MC-10 or a EmCee application on a CoCo without the need to switch servers.

As of v0.4 the following MCX Basic Commands are supported:

* `SETDIR`
* `DIR`
* `LOAD`
* `LOADM`


The following file formats are supported:

* `.C10`
* `.CAS`


## Notes

1. You must use 38400 baud to use the EmCee protocol on  a MC-10 running MCX Basic
2. Saving of files is not currently supported but is in progress
3. The `SETDIR` command works differently than the standard EmCee Server.
4. At the current time pyDriveWire _only_ supports `.C10` and `.CAS` formatted files.  WAV and BIN file support is planned for a future update.
5. At the current time you cannot open a `.C10` or `.CAS` file from the command line.  Use the `LOAD` or `LOADM` command.

## Using pyDriveWire's EmCee Server

The EmCee server in pyDriveWire is on by default and there are no commands to turn it on or off.  The only special requirement is that ***You must use 38400 baud to use the EmCee protocol on  a MC-10 running MCX Basic***.  Please see the rest of this documentation for how to invoke pyDriveWire.  Once pyDriveWire is started you can use the normal MCX Basic commands to access files on the server.

## `SETDIR <path>` - Set the directory on the server

#### Options

* `<path>` --  full path name a directory on the server

#### Description 

The pyDriveWire version of `SETDIR` is different than the normal EmCee server.  You must provide a full path name to the directory you want to switch to.

#### Examples

* Windows: `SETDIR C:\Users\Mikey\MC-10`
* Mac/Linux: `SETDIR /home/Mikey/MC-10`


## `DIR [<path>]` - List directory on the server

#### Options

* `<path>` --  optional full path name a directory on the server

#### Description

List the directory on the server.  The default directory is the one where pyDrivewire was invoked. `<path>` is optional and must be a full path name to the directory you want to list.

#### Examples

* `DIR`
* Windows: `DIR C:\Users\Mikey\MC-10`
* Mac/Linux: `DIR /home/Mikey/MC-10`

## `LOAD <file>` - Load a program from the server

#### Options

* `<file>` -- `.C10/.CAS` file to load from

#### Description 
The pyDriveWire server searches the provided `.C10` or `.CAS` file and loads the first file in the tape image.

## `LOADM` - Load a binary program from the server

#### Options

* `<file>` -- `.C10/.CAS` file to load from

#### Description 
The pyDriveWire server searches the provided `.C10` or `.CAS` file and loads the first BIN file in the tape image.

## EmCee Server Aliases
The pyDriveWire server has a powerful "aliasing" system that is quite different than the official EmCee servers.  The pyDriveWire system has three different types of aliases.  File and Web Aliases can be  with LOAD/SAVE commands and Path Aliases can be used with DIR/SETDIR commands.  The official servers can only use aliases for the `SETDIR` command.

## Aliases are _NOT_ case sensitive
In the pyDriveWire server all alias names are converted to upper case.  For example if you had an alias like this one:

    Server Aliases
    ==============
    Alias: DWTERM.WAV Path: /demo/dwterm.wav

The case of the alias requested from the MC-10 is always converted to upper case so any of the following would load the same alias:

* `LOADM "DWTERM.WAV"`
* `LOADM "dwterm.wav"`
* `LOADM "DwTeRm.WaV"`

## Types of aliases

The PyDriveWire Server supports the following types of Aliases:

* Web Aliases
* Path Aliases
* File Aliases

A _web alias_ is an alias to a HTTP URL.  When the MC-10 requests the alias using a `LOAD` or `LOADM` command the URL which the alias points to will be downloaded to a temporary file and then opened normally.  Note that you won't see the actual file name, and when the file is closed the temp file will be automatically deleted.

A _path alias_ is an alias to a directory.  Path aliases can be used with `DIR` or `SETDIR` commands to change to the directory pointed to by the alias.

A _file alias_ points to a file.  Full or relative pathnames could be used.  When the MC-10 requests the the alias the path to which the alias points to will be used and opened normally.

See the help for `mc alias show` for an example.

## `mc alias show`
Show the currently installed aliases:

    Server Aliases
    ==============
    Alias: POKER.C10 Path: http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/MC-10/Cassettes/Games/Jim%20Gerrie's%20Games/POKER.C10
    Alias: DEMO Path: /demo
    Alias: DWTERM.WAV Path: /demo/dwterm.wav

Explanation of example Aliases:

* `POKER.C10` -- This is a _web alias_ -- `LOAD "POKER.C10"`
* `DEMO` -- This alias is a _directory alias_ -- `SETDIR "DEMO"`
* `DWTERM.WAV` -- This is a _file alias_ -- `LOADM "DWTERM.WAV"`

## `mc alias add <alias> <path>`

Adds the requested alias with path as the destination. The alias is always converted to upper case before addition lookup. The path that an alias points to is case sensitive.  Spaces and punctuation are permitted.

Add a Web Alias:

    pyDriveWire>  mc alias add poker.c10 http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/MC-10/Cassettes/Games/Jim%20Gerrie's%20Games/POKER.C10
    Add Alias
    ==============
    Alias: POKER.C10 Path: http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/MC-10/Cassettes/Games/Jim%20Gerrie's%20Games/POKER.C10

Add a file alias:

    pyDriveWire>  mc alias add dwterm.wav /demo/dwterm.wav
    Add Alias
    ==============
    Alias: DWTERM.WAV Path: /demo/dwterm.wav

## `mc alias remove <alias>`

Remove an alias.  The alias is always converted to upper case before addition removal.

    pyDriveWire>  mc alias remove qbert.c10
    Remove Alias
    ==============
    Alias: QBERT.C10 Path: http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/MC-10/Cassettes/Games/Jim%20Gerrie's%20Games/QBERT.C10

# <a name="ch10"></a>10. Experimental Printing Support

pyDriveWire has experimental printing support.  


pyDriveWire v0.3 includes experimental printing support.  The `-x printer` command line option enables it.  Currently this only suports printing text, and the out is rendered into a PDF.

## Prerequisites

Printing support requires the reportlab module.  This module can be installed with pip:

    pypy -m pip install reportlab

## Use From NitrOS-9

Most of the standard Nitros9 DriveWire builds have printing support built in.  Any program that uses the standard `/P` printing device will work just fine.  A simple example for testing:

    dir >/P

The console log will explain where the output PDF went:

    DWServer: Enabling experimental printing support
    Printing: opening print buffer: /var/folders/1y/cjrxv35d76bc54myg7hy7k1c0000gn/T/tmp2zG0Pb.txt
    Printing to: /var/folders/1y/cjrxv35d76bc54myg7hy7k1c0000gn/T/tmpWdKRQY.pdf
    Printing: closing print buffer: /var/folders/1y/cjrxv35d76bc54myg7hy7k1c0000gn/T/tmp2zG0Pb.txt

## Use from Disk Extended Color Basic
Robert Gault has written some code to redirect printing in BASIC to the DriveWire Printer.

# <a name="ch11"></a>11. Debugging

pyDriveWire has 3 levels of debugging: 

* Default: No Debugging (Level 0)
* Command Debugging (Level 1)
* Connection Debugging (Level 2)

The Debugging option on the command line or config file is _global_ and is applied to All Instances.

Note: The config file option _must_ be put in the first instance.

### Default: Debug Level 0

No debugging commands are sent on the pyDriveWire Console.  This is the default if no debugging option or command is specified.

You may also specify this in the config file:

    option debug 0
    

### Debug Level 1: Command Logging

This debugging level displays one line for each command the DriveWire or EmCee client sends to the server.  See the pyDriveWire Debugging Guide for more detail.


### Command Line:

    -d

### Config file:

    option debug 1

### Debug Level 2: Connection Debugging

This debugging level includes command debug level 1 and in addition to that displays a HexDump of every byte the pyDriveWire server sends and receives from the client.   This can be extremely verbose and slows down the pyDriveWire server slightly so it is not recommended for normal use.  See the pyDriveWire Debugging Guide for more detail.

### Command Line:

    -dd

### Config file:

    option debug 2
